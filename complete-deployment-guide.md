# NFZ Entertainment - Complete Deployment Solution

## 🎯 Issue: Missing package.json in GitHub Repository

Your new repository `websitev2` is missing the essential `package.json` file, which is why the build fails immediately.

## ✅ Complete File Checklist for GitHub Upload

Upload these files to your GitHub repository in this exact order:

### 1. Core Configuration Files (Upload First)
```
deployment-package.json → rename to package.json
deployment-vite.config.ts → rename to vite.config.ts
flat-tailwind.config.ts → rename to tailwind.config.ts
flat-vercel.json → rename to vercel.json
postcss.config.js
deployment-index.html → rename to index.html
```

### 2. Source Code Folders (Upload After)
```
src/ (entire folder with all React components)
shared/ (schemas and types)
attached_assets/ (your kiosk images)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Download Files from Replit
Right-click in Replit file panel → "Download as ZIP"

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Upload files in the order listed above
3. **Critical**: Make sure `package.json` appears in your repository

### Step 3: Verify Upload
Your GitHub should show these files at root level:
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ vite.config.ts  
- ✅ tailwind.config.ts
- ✅ vercel.json
- ✅ index.html
- ✅ src/ folder
- ✅ attached_assets/ folder

### Step 4: Vercel Configuration
- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Build Command**: npm run build
- **Output Directory**: dist
- **Install Command**: npm install

### Step 5: Deploy
Click "Deploy" - it will build successfully!

## 🔧 What Each File Does
- **package.json**: Lists dependencies and build scripts
- **vite.config.ts**: Fixes __dirname issue with proper ES modules
- **index.html**: Entry point with correct import paths
- **src/**: Your complete NFZ website components
- **attached_assets/**: Your kiosk images

## ⚠️ Common Upload Mistakes
- Missing package.json (causes immediate build failure)
- Wrong file names (must match exactly)
- Missing src/ folder (no website to build)
- Missing attached_assets/ (broken images)

Once all files are uploaded correctly, your NFZ Entertainment website will deploy successfully with all features working!
