# NFZ Entertainment - Vercel Deployment Fix

## 🚨 404 Error Fixed - Correct Vercel Setup

The 404 error happened because Vercel needs specific files with exact names. Here's the working solution:

## ✅ Correct Vercel Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload These Exact Files to GitHub

**File 1: `index.html`** (use `vercel-index.html` content)
**File 2: `vercel.json`** (use `vercel-config.json` content)

### Step 2: GitHub Repository Structure
Your repository should look like this:
```
your-repository/
├── index.html          (main website file)
└── vercel.json         (routing configuration)
```

### Step 3: Vercel Import Settings
- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Build Command**: (leave empty)
- **Output Directory**: (leave empty)
- **Install Command**: (leave empty)

### Step 4: Deploy
Click Deploy - it will work immediately without 404 errors.

## 🔧 What Was Wrong Before

- **Missing index.html**: Vercel looks for `index.html` at root
- **Wrong routing**: Needed `vercel.json` to handle routes properly
- **Wrong framework setting**: Should be "Other" not "Static"

## 🎯 What You'll Get

**Working NFZ Entertainment Website:**
- Dark futuristic design with neon cyan effects
- 4D VR technology showcase (heat, cooling, mist, scent)
- Partnership opportunities section for 2026 launch
- Working contact form for partnership inquiries
- Fully responsive mobile design
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Professional branding and messaging

## 📝 Quick Checklist

Before deploying to Vercel:
- ✅ File named exactly `index.html` (not anything else)
- ✅ File named exactly `vercel.json` for routing
- ✅ Framework set to "Other" in Vercel
- ✅ Build settings left empty

**This setup eliminates the 404 error and deploys your NFZ Entertainment website successfully on Vercel.**

## 🌐 Alternative: Netlify (Even Easier)

If Vercel still gives issues:
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Drag the `vercel-index.html` file (any name works on Netlify)
3. Site is live immediately - no configuration needed

Your professional NFZ Entertainment website will be ready for partnership inquiries!
