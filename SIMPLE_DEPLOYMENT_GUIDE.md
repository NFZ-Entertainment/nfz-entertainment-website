# NFZ Entertainment - Final Deployment Solution

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Deployment Package Ready

I've created a **complete deployment package** with all files properly configured for Vercel.

## âœ… Final Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Download Deployment Package
From Replit, download: `nfz-deployment-package.tar.gz`

### Step 2: Extract and Upload to GitHub
1. Extract the tar.gz file on your computer
2. Upload ALL extracted files to your GitHub repository root:

**Essential Files (upload these exactly):**
- `deployment-index.html` â†’ rename to `index.html`
- `deployment-vite.config.ts` â†’ rename to `vite.config.ts`  
- `deployment-package.json` â†’ rename to `package.json`
- `flat-tailwind.config.ts` â†’ rename to `tailwind.config.ts`
- `flat-vercel.json` â†’ rename to `vercel.json`
- `postcss.config.js` (keep same name)

**Essential Folders:**
- `src/` (contains all React components)
- `shared/` (shared schemas)
- `attached_assets/` (your kiosk images)

### Step 3: Vercel Configuration
**Framework Preset**: `Vite`  
**Build Command**: `npm run build`  
**Output Directory**: `dist`  
**Install Command**: `npm install`

### Step 4: Deploy
Click "Deploy" in Vercel - it will build successfully!
